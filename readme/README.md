<u> Who are we?</u>

The Irish Golf Society is a fictional Golf society, organising premium Golf days, in a long running societal format. The main ethos for the society is to encourage golfers of any ability/background to enjoy great experiences in friendly and inclusive environment. 

Founded by two brothers, John and James (?) who felt as though there was a niche in the market for golfers who wanted the opportunity to play premium courses for much better value than was being offered in the open market.

To provide context, they have devised the following networking business model:

1. Collaborate with the most forward-thinking premium Golf Clubs around to purchase blocks of tee-times for discounted prices (by economies of scale) in advance. 
2. Collaborate with key players in the Golf market to provide great prizes through sponsorship. 
3. Aggressively market the society and it's benefits/ethos through postering in clubs and a website. 
4. Gain traction for community growth through word of mouth/social media from participants regarding enjoyment/value/fulfillment of events attended/prizes won/free stuff accrued.
5. Greater number of community players involved = greater purchasing econmies of scale/greater value for sponsors.

<u>Why do the IGS need a website?</u>

1. As a marketing tool to new potential players.
2. An interface to register for an event of the user's choosing through the registration form.
3. Source of society news.
4. Results/Leaderboard information for existing participants. 
5. Sponsorship affiliation.
